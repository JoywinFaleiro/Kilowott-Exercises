# Kilowott-Exercises
## Exercise 1 
Problem statement<br>
Fizz-Buzz: Write a program that will print numbers from 1 to 30, with the following
exceptions that when the number is divisible by 3, the word “Fizz” is printed instead
of the number, and when the number is divisible by 5, the word “Buzz” is printed
instead of the number, and when the number is divisible by by both 3 and 5, then the
word “FizzBuzz” is printed instead of the number. 

Tasks <br>
a. Write the output sequence of what the output will look like<br>
b. Write the algorithm for delivering the output<br>
c. Write the program that follows the algorithm<br>

### Exercise 2 
Problem statement<br>
Number to Ordinal: Write a program that will take as input any number from the
user and will print the “ordinal” form of the number. For example, when the user
enters the number “31”, the program will respond with “thirty first”

Tasks<br>
